And the Ruwach of ELOHIYM moved upon the face of the waters.\n3 And ELOHIYM said, Let there be light: and there was light.\n4 And ELOHIYM saw the light, that it was good: and ELOHIYM divided the light from the darkness.\n5 And ELOHIYM called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\n6 And ELOHIYM said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.\n7 And ELOHIYM made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.\n8 And ELOHIYM called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.\n9 And ELOHIYM said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.\n10 And ELOHIYM called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and ELOHIYM saw that it was good.\n11 And ELOHIYM said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.\n12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and ELOHIYM saw that it was good.\n13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.\n14 And ELOHIYM said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:\n15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.\n16 And ELOHIYM made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.\n17 And ELOHIYM set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,\n18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and ELOHIYM saw that it was good.\n19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.\n20 And ELOHIYM said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.\n21 And ELOHIYM created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and ELOHIYM saw that it was good.\n22 And ELOHIYM barakat them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.\n23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\n24 And ELOHIYM said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.\n25 And ELOHIYM made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and ELOHIYM saw that it was good.\n26 And ELOHIYM said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\n27 So ELOHIYM created man in his own image, in the image of ELOHIYM created he him; male and female created he them.\n28 And ELOHIYM barakat them, and ELOHIYM said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.\n29 And ELOHIYM said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon theface of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.\n30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.\n31 And ELOHIYM saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.\nGENESIS 2\n1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.\n2 And on the seventh day ELOHIYM ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.\n3 And ELOHIYM barakat the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which ELOHIYM created and made.\n4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the YAHAWAH ELOHIYM made the earth and the heavens,\n5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the YAHAWAH ELOHIYM had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.\n6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.\n7 And the YAHAWAH ELOHIYM formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\n8 And the YAHAWAH ELOHIYM planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.\n9 And out of the ground made the YAHAWAHELOHIYM to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\n10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.\n11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;\n12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.\n13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.\n14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.\n15 And the YAHAWAH ELOHIYM took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.\n16 And the YAHAWAH ELOHIYM commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:\n17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\n18 And the YAHAWAH ELOHIYM said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.\n19 And out of the ground the YAHAWAHELOHIYM formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.\n20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.\n21 And the YAHAWAH ELOHIYM caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;\n22 And the rib, which the YAHAWAHELOHIYM had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.\n23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.\n24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\n25 And they were both naked (unvarnished), the man and his wife, and were not ashamed\nGENESIS 3\n1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the YAHAWAHELOHIYM had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath ELOHIYM said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?\n2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:\n3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, ELOHIYM hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.\n4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:\n5 For ELOHIYM doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as deities, knowing good and evil.\n6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.\n7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.\n8 And they heard the voice of the YAHAWAHELOHIYM walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the YAHAWAH ELOHIYM amongst the trees of the garden.\n9 And the YAHAWAH ELOHIYM called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?\n10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.\n11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?\n12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.\n13 And the YAHAWAH ELOHIYM said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\n14 And the YAHAWAH ELOHIYM said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:\n15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\n16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\n17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;\n18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;\n19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\n20 And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.\n21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the YAHAWAH ELOHIYM make coats of skins, and clothed them.\n22 And the YAHAWAH ELOHIYM said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:\n23 Therefore the YAHAWAH ELOHIYM sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.\n24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.\nGENESIS 4\n1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the YAHAWAH.\n2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.\n3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the YAHAWAH.\n4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the YAHAWAHhad respect unto Abel and to his offering:\n5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.\n6 And the YAHAWAH said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?\n7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.\n8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.\n9 And the YAHAWAH said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother’s keeper?\n10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.\n11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;\n12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.\n13 And Cain said unto the YAHAWAH, My punishment is greater than I can bear.\n14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.\n15 And the YAHAWAH said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the YAHAWAH set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.\n16 And Cain went out from the presence of the YAHAWAH, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.\n17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.\n18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehuyael: and Mehuyael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.\n19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.\n20 And Adah bare Yabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.\n21 And his brother’s name was Yuval: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.\n22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.\n23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.\n24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.\n25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For ELOHIYM, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.\n26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the YAHAWAH.\nGENESIS 5\n1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that ELOHIYM created man, in the likeness of ELOHIYM made he him;\n2 Male and female created he them; and barakat them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.\n3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth:\n4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:\n5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.\n6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:\n7 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:\n8 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.\n9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:\n10 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:\n11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.\n12 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel:\n13 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:\n14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.\n15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Yared:\n16 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Yared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:\n17 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.\n18 And Yared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:\n19 And Yared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:\n20 And all the days of Yared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.\n21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:\n22 And Enoch walked with ELOHIYM after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:\n23 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:\n24 And Enoch walked with ELOHIYM: and he was not; for ELOHIYM took him.\n25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech.\n26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:\n27 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.\n28 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:\n29 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the YAHAWAH hath cursed.\n30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:\n31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.\n32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Yefet\n\"\"\"","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-21T09:52:42.934116Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-21T09:52:42.934422Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-21T09:52:42.952004Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-21T09:52:42.934399Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-21T09:52:42.950426Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# parser can often provide helpful format instructions for JSON\nformat_instruction = parser.get_format_instructions()\n\n# invoke the chain (Runnable API).
